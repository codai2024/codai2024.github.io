<p>The first edition of CODAI will be co-located with ECAI, in S19-24 OCTOBER 2024 Santiago de Compostela.</p>

<p>Social media platforms which have been designed primarily to allow users to create and share content with others, have become integral parts of modern communication, enabling people to connect with friends, family as well as for broadcasting information to a wider audience. On one side these platforms provide an opportunity to facilitate discussions in an open and free environment.  On the flip side, new societal issues have started emerging on these platforms.  Among all the issues, the topic of misinformation has been prevalent on these platforms. The term misinformation is an umbrella term which encompasses various entities such as fake news, hoaxes, rumors to name a few. While misinformation refers to non-intentional spread of non-authentic information, the term disinformation points to spreading of a piece of inauthentic information with certain malign intentions.</p>

<p>Initially, researchers have mainly focused on identifying and characterizing misinformation using text based techniques through traditional and advanced NLP techniques. However, with the advancement of techniques and availability of various AI tools, the (mis)information has started appearing in the form of multimodality. For example, a piece of image with incorrect text embedded on it or a morphed video with audio. In addition, the topic of misinformation has impacted individuals and communities from various domains such as medical, political, entertainment, business, etc. This calls for combining forces from different domains. In other words, to counter misinformation computer scientists need to work with domain specialists. To understand the intention a psychologist‚Äôs inputs can also be vital to understand the reasons for the spreading of misinformation. To summarize, a holistic view is needed to counter the menace of misinformation spread on online social media platforms.</p>

<p>The International Workshop ‚ÄúCODAI: COuntering Disinformation with Artificial Intelligence‚Äù provides a platform for researchers from various domains to come together and not only present their works but also provide an ecosystem to discuss ideas which can facilitate countering the spread of misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop description</h2>

<p>Many recent performance improvements in NLP have come at the cost of understanding of the systems. How do we assess what representations and computations models learn? How do we formalize desirable properties of interpretable models, and measure the extent to which existing models achieve them? How can we build models that better encode these properties? What can new or existing tools tell us about these systems‚Äô inductive biases?</p>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers focused on interpreting and explaining NLP models by taking inspiration from fields such as machine learning, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. We hope the workshop will serve as an interdisciplinary meetup that allows for cross-collaboration.</p>

<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explanation methods such as saliency, attribution, free-text explanations, or explanations with structured properties.</li>
  <li>Mechanistic interpretability, reverse engineering approaches to understanding particular properties of neural models.</li>
  <li>Probing methods for testing whether models have acquired or represent certain linguistic properties.</li>
  <li>Applying analysis techniques from other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience or computer vision).</li>
  <li>Examining model performance on simplified or formal languages.</li>
  <li>Proposing modifications to neural architectures that increase their interpretability.</li>
  <li>Open-source tools for analysis, visualization, or explanation.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of explanation methods: how do we know the explanation is faithful to the model?</li>
  <li>Opinion pieces about the state of explainable NLP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to reach out to the organizers at the email below if you are not sure whether a specific topic is well-suited for submission.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>
<p>We will accept submissions through Softconf at: <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/">https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/</a>. All submissions should use the EMNLP 2023 <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-emnlp-2023-proceedings/scyjxmtnrskr">template</a> and formatting requirements specified by <a href="https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html">ACL</a>. Archival paper must be fully anonymized. Submissions of both types can be made through <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2023/blackboxnlp2023/">Softconf</a>.</p>

<h3 id="submission-types">Submission Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Archival papers</strong> of up to 8 pages + references. These are papers reporting on completed, original and unpublished research. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings of the ACL Anthology, meaning they cannot be published elsewhere. They should report on obtained results rather than intended work. Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on a 9th page.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-archival extended abstracts</strong> of 2 pages + references. These may report on work in progress or may be cross-submissions of work that has already appeared (or is scheduled to appear) in another venue in 2022-2023. Abstract titles will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the proceedings. The selection will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accepted submissions for both tracks will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).</p>

<h3 id="dual-submissions-and-preprints">Dual Submissions and Preprints</h3>
<p>Dual submissions <strong>are</strong> allowed for the archival track, but please check the dual submissions policy for the other venue that you are dual-submitting to. Papers posted to preprint servers such as arXiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.</p>

<h3 id="camera-ready-information">Camera-ready information</h3>
<p>Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use <strong>one extra page</strong> to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages + references. Broader Impacts/Ethics and Limitations sections are optional and can be included on a 10th page.</p>
