<p>The first edition of CODAI will be on 20 Oct, co-located with ECAI, in 19-24 OCTOBER 2024 Santiago de Compostela.</p>
<p>Social media platforms which have been designed primarily to allow users to create and share content with others, have become integral parts of modern communication, enabling people to connect with friends, family as well as for broadcasting information to a wider audience. On one side these platforms provide an opportunity to facilitate discussions in an open and free environment.  On the flip side, new societal issues have started emerging on these platforms.  Among all the issues, the topic of misinformation has been prevalent on these platforms. The term misinformation is an umbrella term which encompasses various entities such as fake news, hoaxes, rumors to name a few. While misinformation refers to non-intentional spread of non-authentic information, the term disinformation points to spreading of a piece of inauthentic information with certain malign intentions.</p>

<p>Initially, researchers have mainly focused on identifying and characterizing misinformation using text based techniques through traditional and advanced NLP techniques. However, with the advancement of techniques and availability of various AI tools, the (mis)information has started appearing in the form of multimodality. For example, a piece of image with incorrect text embedded on it or a morphed video with audio. In addition, the topic of misinformation has impacted individuals and communities from various domains such as medical, political, entertainment, business, etc. This calls for combining forces from different domains. In other words, to counter misinformation computer scientists need to work with domain specialists. To understand the intention a psychologist’s inputs can also be vital to understand the reasons for the spreading of misinformation. To summarize, a holistic view is needed to counter the menace of misinformation spread on online social media platforms.</p>

<p>The International Workshop “CODAI: COuntering Disinformation with Artificial Intelligence” provides a platform for researchers from various domains to come together and not only present their works but also provide an ecosystem to discuss ideas which can facilitate countering the spread of misinformation.</p>

<p><strong>Countering disinformation with AI: discriminating conspiracy theories from critical thinking</strong><br /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The rise of social media has offered a fast and easy way for the propagation of disinformation 
	  and conspiracy theories. Despite the research attention that has received, disinformation 
	  detection remains an open problem and users keep sharing texts that contain false statements. 
	  In this keynote I will briefly describe how to go beyond textual information to detect disinformation, 
	  taking into account also affective and visual information because providing important insights on
	  how disinformation spreaders aim at triggering certain emotions in the readers. I will also describe
	  how psycholinguistic patterns and users' personality traits may play an important role in discriminating 
	  disinformation spreaders from fact checkers. Moreover, I will comment on some studies on the propagation 
	  of conspiracy theories. In the framework of the PAN Lab at CLEF, we are organising a challenge on 
	  oppositional thinking analysis to discriminate between conspiracy narratives and critical thinking. 
	  This distinction between critical and conspiracist narratives is vital because considering a message 
	  as conspiratorial when it is only oppositional to mainstream views could start a psychosocial 
	  process that drives into the arms of the conspiracy communities those who were simply critical about 
	  controversial topics such as vaccination or climate change. Most of the work was done in the framework of
	  IBERIFIER, the Iberian media research & fact-checking hub on disinformation funded by the European 
	  Digital Media Observatory, and the research projects XAI-DisInfodemics (eXplainable AI for disinformation
	  and conspiracy detection during infodemics), and FAKEnHATE-PdC (FAKE news and HATE speech).</p>

<p><strong>Rethinking the problem of disinformation and Artificial Intelligence: boundaries, threats, and trends</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Disinformation (and more generally misinformation) is spreading everywhere online, causing problems for individuals, societies, and countries.  
	  This unchecked dissemination of falsehoods, has nurtured an environment ripe for the proliferation of rumors, propaganda, and hoaxes, 
	  exacting a toll on the economic, political, and public health realms, among many other aspects in our daily lives. Confronting this multifaceted
	  adversary demands a united front, drawing upon the collective wisdom and resources of diverse stakeholders including individuals, media entities, governmental bodies, 
	  technology firms, and scholars. This keynote endeavours to illuminate the intricate contours of this challenge, delving into some popular Computational 
	  techniques such as Machine Learning and Graph Computing as a new set of weapons in the battle against misinformation. Focused primarily on three domains, 
	  Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) and Social Network Analysis (SNA), our discourse aims to unveil the potential of 
	  these techniques in discerning truth from falsehood. Within the realm of NLP/MDL and SNA, particular attention will be devoted to the facter-check 
	  architecture, a novel framework that through the use of ensembles and deep learning techniques based in Transformer technology, enables the 
	  identification and tracking of misleading content across the vast expanse of online social networks.  </p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop description</h2>

<p>Many recent performance improvements in NLP have come at the cost of understanding of the systems. How do we assess what representations and computations models learn? How do we formalize desirable properties of interpretable models, and measure the extent to which existing models achieve them? How can we build models that better encode these properties? What can new or existing tools tell us about these systems’ inductive biases?</p>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers focused on interpreting and explaining NLP models by taking inspiration from fields such as machine learning, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience. We hope the workshop will serve as an interdisciplinary meetup that allows for cross-collaboration.</p>

<p>The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explanation methods such as saliency, attribution, free-text explanations, or explanations with structured properties.</li>
  <li>Mechanistic interpretability, reverse engineering approaches to understanding particular properties of neural models.</li>
  <li>Probing methods for testing whether models have acquired or represent certain linguistic properties.</li>
  <li>Applying analysis techniques from other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience or computer vision).</li>
  <li>Examining model performance on simplified or formal languages.</li>
  <li>Proposing modifications to neural architectures that increase their interpretability.</li>
  <li>Open-source tools for analysis, visualization, or explanation.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of explanation methods: how do we know the explanation is faithful to the model?</li>
  <li>Opinion pieces about the state of explainable NLP.</li>
</ul>
